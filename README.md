# Solvide - Excel your Learning Ride

Note : At last moment, my devices got hanged, due to which I couldn't provide a demo. But here is the most versatile learning platform.

## Inspiration

Inspired from slow progess in education sector

## My project

This project helps in excelling the learning ride. In short, students especially in rural areas face difficulties in studies with no mentor to guide. Here, we can use the keywords to grab the links for smoother learning. It has inbuilt utterit feature that would acts as your study partner who hear out the notes for you and asks you to utter it. Other than this, a well needed feature of fetching you with the mandatory topics from your notes using keywords.  

## What I had done

I had built using python, html and css and also deployed flask and integrated front end development with the backend code. It smartens up the learnings especially where students aren't aware of the concepts, low acess to books and wants to grasp the knowledge as much as they could. I had also used NLP, TensorFlow and API's involved to gain links about keywords and notes

## Issue

The pressing issue of education sector is taken here. Especially in MENA regions, there's a less feasibility to quality education and also no proper mentor to guide them especially when they are confined or restricted in conflict areas.

## Solution

This App would be a best fit solution to guide students and educate them in a right way so that they could enhance their learning ride, understand the concepts well, be their own study partner to excel in their subjects. The features added are a huge plus to the budding minds. 

## Challenges

The main challenge was with front end development and bringing them both together. Enabling the flask, activating the app, writing html and css pages. Definitely a daunting task being alone person to work on and managing it in right path

## Achieved

Proud of doing so much in such a less frame of time. Never thought I would come up with some idea like this that would benefit students

## My Learnings 

Learnt about flask, writing html and css codes, enabling styling, providing the access to the features, merging the features properly. It was a nerve wracking time frame to finish it off. Wish I had more time to make it finesse and also scratch more of the webapp deeply with extra add-ons needed. 

## Next Step to Solvide

I would add up more features that would benefit students in their study habits and also make their learn more easier.
